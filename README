Java API for HipChat
======

This library contains an wrapper for the HipChat WS API allowing applications to access your HipChat rooms and users from Java. The API exposes all methods available via the API through simple Room and User objects.

Getting Started
=====

I will write a more complete example, but the basic process is to create a HipChat instance using your API key and then use that instance to call methods against your rooms and users. I tried to make the API focus on reusing objects retrieved from the server. The API provided by HipChat has roughly 10 or so major functions, and it should be easy to find the same functionality in this code.
